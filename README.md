# Student Performance Analysis using Machine Learning

This project analyzes student performance data using various machine learning models, including Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, and Logistic Regression. The aim is to predict student exam performance, group students based on their characteristics, and classify whether a student's performance improves.

## Project Overview

- **Random Forest**: Predicts final exam scores based on previous performance metrics.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups students into clusters based on performance and access patterns.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classifies whether a studentâ€™s performance improved using a binary approach.

## Models Used

1. **Random Forest**: Predicts the final exam scores.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Groups students into clusters based on their performance.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Classifies performance improvement (binary classification).

## Dataset

The dataset contains student performance metrics like practice exam scores, final exam scores, and average grades for various quarters.

| Column          | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Practice_Exam` | Scores from practice exams                          |
| `Final_Exam`    | Final exam scores                                   |
| `Avg_Grade_Q1`  | Average grades for the first quarter                 |
| `No_access_Q1`  | Number of times students accessed resources in Q1    |
| ...             | ...                                                  |
